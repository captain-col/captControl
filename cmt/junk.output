//! \brief Generate a UUID in a system independent way.
//! 
//! Deal with the possibility that not all systems support the same UUID
//! generation tools.  This works down a list of possible UUID generators
//! until one that works is found.  If none is found, then it "fakes" a uuid.
//! This prefers uuidgen, but if it isn't found tries to use the linux
//! kernel interface.  If that isn't found, then it fails
