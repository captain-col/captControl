package captControl
# This package provides the run control tools used to build captain jobs.
# The CAPTAIN job control language is "bash", and the scripts are tools to
# make writing the bash shell scripts easy.
#
# Notice that this package does not depend on any of the packages
# containing executables.  This allows the package to be used without
# creating circular dependencies.  The dependencies of this package should be
# limited to captainPolicy.
